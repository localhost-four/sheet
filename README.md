There are no subtitles or dialogues in this game, since the main character is not sick, but can briefly express his thoughts or what he thinks about the objects he looks at.
He doesn’t have a family or once had one, he thinks that smart thoughts left him because of the vivid memories in his head.
He is looking for answers to big questions related to his fate at the moment.
The whole world is surrounded by places that are very familiar to him, but it is difficult to remember such a place in his reality.
Therefore, he leaves home and heads to the nearest metro.
